This app was made because I wanted to learn some languages that were not on Duolingo (An excellent and free language learning app). After searching the internet I decided that there was no good alternatives. I would have settled for learning from a textbook when I thought of using Google Translate to assist the creation of an app that would allow a user to learn any language available on Google Translate. Although in very early stages, the language app, with the help of third party python libraries: googletrans and gtts (google text to speech), has succeeded in translating basic phrases to the language the user is learning and allowing them to figure out the english translation by use of a wordbank (much like Duolingo). Many more features are in progress. But eventually, this will be a totally free and open-source language learning app.
