This is a free, open-source app designed from necessity, the necessity to learn languages that are not available for learning on Duolingo. And most others require payment.
Day 1: Made the server, made a basic screen displaying all the languages, made a translator using the googletrans library, and created a basic lesson game, where users must attempt to translate a simple phrase into english with a word bank.

Future plans:
New word recogniser: It will write out three versions of translated text: The man ate, the man eats, the man will eat. And compares them maybe?
Reverse Translation: The wordbank is in the other language and users must translate it
Custom difficulty settings: Users can customise the difficulty to their liking (As well as a natural progression), as they learn new words, the bubbles might disappear altogether and they have to write out the answer, problem is, it may be similar but not exact. More complex sentences.
Audio: Could be pretty straightforward, just need something that can pronounce only EVERY SINGLE LANGUAGE ON GOOGLE. Maybe something that can pronounce the pronunciations, won't be quite right.
Learn the sounds: Group similar sounds together
Group voiced vs unvoiced maybe? Vowels and consonants: Click and drag them into two places.
